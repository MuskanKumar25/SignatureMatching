# SignatureMatching
 Project to analyze and compare signatures using image processing and computer vision techniques .

The project aims to develop a signature similarity analysis system using image processing and computer vision techniques. The system will take input images of signatures and use various image processing algorithms to compare and determine the similarity between them.
